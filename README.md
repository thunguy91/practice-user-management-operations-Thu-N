# SQL Practice

This project helped me practice basic SQL commands like inserting, updating, deleting, and selecting data using MySQL. 
I learned how to filter, sort, and limit results to work with user data more effectively. The trickiest part for me was making 
sure my UPDATE and DELETE queries only affected the rows I intended.
